# Smart-Loan-Approval-Prediction-System-Using-Machine-Learning
This dataset is designed for a binary classification problem to predict whether a loan application will be approved (Y) or rejected (N). It is a standard dataset used for training machine learning models, particularly for exploring classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
