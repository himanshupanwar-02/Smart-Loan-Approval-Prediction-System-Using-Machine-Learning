Smart Loan Approval Prediction System Using Machine Learning

--------------------------------------------------

Project Overview:
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected. The system analyzes applicant information and helps banks make faster and more accurate loan approval decisions.

--------------------------------------------------

Objective:
To build a machine learning classification model that predicts loan approval status.

Loan_Status:
Y  -> Loan Approved
N  -> Loan Rejected

--------------------------------------------------

Dataset Description:
The dataset contains applicant details such as:
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Education
- Applicant Income
- Coapplicant Income
- Loan Amount
- Credit History
- Property Area

--------------------------------------------------

Technologies Used:
Python
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib

--------------------------------------------------

Project Workflow:
1. Load the dataset
2. Handle missing values
3. Encode categorical variables
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets
5. Train the machine learning model (KNN / Decision Tree)
6. Evaluate the model using accuracy

--------------------------------------------------

Output:
The model predicts whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on applicant data.

--------------------------------------------------

Use Cases:
- Banking and financial institutions
- Academic mini projects
- Machine learning practice
- Resume and portfolio project
